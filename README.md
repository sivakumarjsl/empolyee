# React js and node js with mysql DB.

You will surely learn reddux and mysql db connection and node js code with express frame work.

Actually am just create sample application for employee details storage.

Major role:
   ADD, modify, and delete your employee details in this application.
   
   
 Explaintion about design and functionality:
    
    Am just olay with antd desin here for my forent end side . in my other hand am used express frame work with node js code.
    
    
What is react?
   Bascially you guys alreaddy know about react js
   1. javascript libraray 
   2. Help to design complex Ui easily.
   3. we can reuseable component here.

Node js?
  In my knowledge node js nothing but inner mediate connecction for client and DB side (like mysql or postgresql whatever u choose)
  

What are thing you need to do to before run a application:

   Make sure you have npm , xampp, mysql those things we need to install before start.
   
My small concern here:
   After create or modify  the employee user after you need go back your employee then please clik home link above your form . it's just like breadcrumb.
